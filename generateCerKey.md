The first OpenSSL command generates a 2048-bit (recommended) RSA private key.

The second command generates a Certificate Signing Request, which you could instead use to generate a CA-signed certificate. This step will ask you questions; be as accurate as you like since you probably arenâ€™t getting this signed by a CA.

The third command generates a self-signed x509 certificate suitable for use on web servers. This is the file you were after all along, congrats!

The check at the end ensures you will be able to use your certificate beyond 2016. OpenSSL on OS X is currently insufficient, and will silently generate a SHA-1 certificate that will be rejected by browsers in 2017. Update using your package manager, or with Homebrew on a Mac and start the process over.
